# Portfolio-Tracker-Application
Excited to share that I've been working on an assignment to build a Simple Portfolio Tracker Application using modern web technologies. The application allows users to manage their stock holdings, track the total portfolio value based on real-time stock prices, and view key portfolio metrics through a responsive dashboard.

Here’s what I’ve built:

Frontend: Developed a responsive web app with React, providing a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting stock holdings.
Backend: Built the backend using Java with Spring Boot, exposing RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations and calculate the portfolio value.
Database: Designed a MySQL database schema to store stock details and relationships with portfolios.
Real-Time Data Integration: Integrated with a stock price API (Alpha Vantage) to fetch live prices and dynamically update portfolio value.
Deployment: Deployed the app on platforms like Heroku (Backend) and Vercel (Frontend).
This project helped me enhance my skills in React, Spring Boot, MySQL, and API integration, while also giving me practical experience in building full-stack applications. I'm excited about how this project showcases my ability to work with both frontend and backend technologies.

Feel free to check out the project on my GitHub and provide feedback!
